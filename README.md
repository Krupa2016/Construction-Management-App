# 🏗️ Construction Field Management Application

A **mobile-first, offline-friendly construction field management application** designed to digitize daily site operations and replace unstructured WhatsApp messages, phone calls, and paper registers with a single unified platform.

The application is tailored for **real construction sites in India**, focusing on simplicity, low-connectivity support, and role-based workflows for site engineers, managers, and owners.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Construction sites today rely heavily on:
- WhatsApp messages  
- Phone calls  
- Paper-based registers  

This leads to:
- Poor visibility into site progress  
- Material and labor leakages  
- Delays in approvals and billing  
- Lack of accountability  

This project digitizes **attendance, daily progress reports (DPR), material management, approvals, and billing** into one structured system.
